### Configuration Summary
- **Model 1**: *nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-fp8* – 30 GB image, 30 B parameters, 8‑bit FP8 quantization, **requires 33 GB VRAM**.  
- **Model 2**: *apertus-8b-instruct-2509-fp8-dynamic* – 8.53 GB image, 8 B parameters, 8‑bit FP8 quantization, **requires 9 GB VRAM**.  
- **Total VRAM estimate**: **42 GB** (summarized by the Configuration Specialist).

### Accelerator Summary
- The Accelerator Specialist reported **authentication failure**: “Cluster authentication failed – please log in to your OpenShift cluster.”  
- No GPU resources were detected; `gpu_available` is `false`, `gpu_provider` is `UNKNOWN`, and no `vllm_runtime_image` was returned.  
- Because of this connectivity/authentication issue, the cluster is considered **unavailable** for deployment.

### Deployment Decision
- **Decision**: **NO‑GO**.  
- **Rationale**:  
  - **GPU capacity**: Unknown due to authentication failure; cannot confirm that the required 42 GB VRAM is available.  
  - **Serving‑argument suitability**: Not evaluated because the environment cannot be inspected.  
  - **Environment / access health**: Authentication failure prevents any reliable deployment; per policy, this mandates a NO‑GO verdict.  
- No optimized serving arguments were applied, and no configuration changes were made.

### QA Validation
- **Not run** – the QA Specialist was not invoked because the accelerator step indicated an authentication/connectivity failure, making QA impossible.
