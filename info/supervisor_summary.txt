### Configuration Summary
The Configuration Specialist reported the following details for the model-car configuration:
- **Model:** ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512
- **Image Size:** 29.34 GB
- **Parameter Count:** 14 Billion
- **Estimated VRAM:** 31 GB
- **Supported Architectures:** amd64

### Accelerator Summary
The Accelerator Specialist inspected the cluster and provided the following summary:
- **Status:** GPU available
- **Provider:** NVIDIA
- **Compatibility:** The cluster supports CUDA-compatible models and the vLLM runtime.
- **vLLM Runtime Image:** `registry.redhat.io/rhaiis/vllm-cuda-rhel9@sha256:094db84a1da5e8a575d0c9eade114fa30f4a2061064a338e3e032f3578f8082a`

### Deployment Decision
The Decision Specialist issued a **GO** verdict for deployment.
- **GPU Capacity:** The model's estimated VRAM requirement of 31 GB fits within the available 40 GB per GPU on the cluster.
- **Serving Arguments:** The initial configuration was missing serving arguments. The specialist recommended and applied a safe default configuration for single-GPU deployment to ensure stability.
- **Configuration Update:** The optimized serving arguments were successfully written back to the model-car configuration. The applied optimization was:
  
```json
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
  ```

- **Environment Health:** The cluster environment is healthy and accessible.

### QA Validation
The QA Specialist reported that the validation tests **FAILED**.
- **Reason for Failure:** The tests failed during the model-serving pod initialization. The `storage-initializer` container could not download the model artifacts because the `storageUri` was invalid. The system was incorrectly configured to use the model's container image path as a storage URI, which is not a supported protocol.
- **Recommendation:** The `InferenceService` configuration must be corrected by the development team to point the `storageUri` to a valid model artifact location (e.g., S3, GCS, or an HTTP server) or be removed if the model is packaged within the container image itself.
