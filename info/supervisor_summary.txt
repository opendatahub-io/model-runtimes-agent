### Accelerator Summary
The Accelerator Specialist reported the following about the cluster's environment:
- **GPU Available:** Yes
- **Provider:** NVIDIA
- **vLLM Runtime Image:** `registry.redhat.io/rhaiis/vllm-cuda-rhel9@sha256:094db84a1da5e8a575d0c9eade114fa30f4a2061064a338e3e032f3578f8082a`
- The cluster is accessible and authentication was successful.

### Deployment Decision
**Overall Verdict: NO-GO**

The Decision Specialist initially provided a **GO** decision for three models (`modelcar-ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512`, `modelcar-qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct-quantized-w4a16`, and `modelcar-qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct-nvfp4`), which would have utilized 7 of the 8 available GPUs. The specialist also generated optimized serving arguments, including critical `tensor-parallel-size` settings, to enable the models to be deployed correctly.

However, a critical error occurred when attempting to apply these optimized serving arguments back into the model-car configuration. The Configuration Specialist failed with the error: `Error: Failed to read decision_matrix.json: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`.

Because the optimized serving arguments could not be applied, the deployment is considered unsafe and is therefore a **NO-GO**. Deploying without the correct `tensor-parallel-size` would lead to runtime failures and resource mismanagement.

### QA Validation
QA validation was **not run**. The failure to apply the necessary serving argument optimizations to the model-car configuration prevented the QA tests from being initiated. Running validation on an incorrect configuration would not produce meaningful results.
