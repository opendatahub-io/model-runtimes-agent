This is a **GO** for deployment.

### Deployability Decision Report

| Model Name | Deployable | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512 | **Deployable** | The model is deployable as it requires 31 GB of VRAM, which fits into the available 40 GB per GPU. Serving arguments were missing and have been added with safe defaults, including setting tensor_parallel_size=1 for single-GPU deployment. |

### Optimized Serving Arguments

The original model configuration was missing serving arguments. The following configuration provides safe defaults for single-GPU deployment.
```json
{
  "model_name": "ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512",
  "serving_arguments": {
    "args": [
      "--uvicorn-log-level=info",
      "--trust-remote-code",
      "--tensor-parallel-size=1",
      "--max-model-len=2048"
    ],
    "gpu_count": 1
  }
}
```
